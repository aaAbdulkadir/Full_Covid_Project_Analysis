# Full_Covid_Project_Analysis
COVID Data Automation Project

This project consists of a python script which collects the world COVID data through webscraping and filters that data into multiple datasets which is analysed and turned into visualisations. This was done using pandas and matplotlib, Additionally, the data was also imported to SQL using python and queried on python using SQL queries. This SQL data was used to create a dashboard on Tableau. This script was automated so that it collects data everyday and hence, updating the dashboard. The daily automation was done by converting the ipynb file py and using Windows Task Scheduler to run the file.
